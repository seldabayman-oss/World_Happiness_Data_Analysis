## 🌍 World Happiness Report Dashboard (2015–2019)
This repository contains my detailed Power BI dashboard exploring global happiness trends across 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 using the World Happiness Report datasets.

## 📈 Project Objective
In this project, I aimed to uncover:

How global happiness scores evolved over time.
The relationship between GDP per Capita, Freedom, Healthy Life Expectancy, Generosity, Corruption Perception and overall Happiness Score.
Which countries stand out with high income but moderate happiness.
Regional differences and how Asia’s key players (e.g., Japan, Hong Kong) shifted in recent years.

## 🔍 Key Insights
✨ Healthy Life Expectancy shows a clear upward trend: 5.80 → 7.25
✨ Freedom peaked in 2018 but slightly dropped in 2019 — possibly due to early economic stress signals and the pandemic context.
✨ GDP per Capita increased consistently from 7.99 → 9.05 (scaled data).
✨ Generosity steadily declined, hinting at lifestyle shifts in an increasingly digital and individualistic world.
✨ Countries like Qatar, Luxembourg, Singapore have extremely high GDP but only moderate Happiness Scores — proving that wealth alone doesn’t guarantee well-being.
✨ Countries with the lowest perceived corruption include Canada, while top-ranked countries for freedom include Sweden, Norway, Switzerland.
✨ Japan & Hong Kong showed upward momentum in Happiness Score and social support metrics in 2018–2019, signaling notable socio-economic improvements in East Asia.

## 🗂️ Datasets Used
📌 Source: World Happiness Report on Kaggle
Separate CSV files for each year (2015, 2016, 2018, 2019)
Merged and cleaned using Power Query (M Code) in Power BI

## ⚙️ Tools & Methods
Power BI Desktop
Power Query (M Language) for data cleaning:
Column transformations, data type corrections, regional formatting fixes
DAX for calculated columns and KPI adjustments
Custom visuals:
Bubble maps
Year-over-year KPI cards
Slicers for dynamic filtering
Trend lines and bar charts
Insight annotations added for better storytelling

## ✅ Main Dashboard Features
📌 Global Map View: Countries visualized by Happiness Score and GDP per Capita
📌 Year Slicer: Easily compare metrics across years
📌 Key KPIs: Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom, GDP per Capita, Generosity, Perception of Corruption, Social Support
📌 Regional Focus: Highlights notable shifts in Asia (Japan, Hong Kong)

## 🧩 Why This Matters
This project shows that happiness is multidimensional: income is not the sole driver. Social freedom, healthy life conditions, trust in government, and generosity all shape how people perceive their quality of life.

For example:

Some Gulf countries have extremely high GDP but score moderate on happiness due to possible constraints on freedom or social factors.
Scandinavian countries consistently rank high in freedom and happiness, despite GDP per Capita not always being the highest.
The post-2018 slight drop in global freedom scores could foreshadow socio-political challenges leading into the pandemic years.

## 📥 How To Use

## 🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Merge all years into a single append query for smoother model performance.
✅ Add Play Axis to animate country scores over time.
✅ Integrate updated datasets for 2020–2023 to see post-pandemic shifts.
✅ Publish an interactive version on Power BI Service or embed on a portfolio website.
